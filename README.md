Attendance System Using Face Recognition

This project is an Attendance Management System built using Python and OpenCV that leverages face recognition technology to mark attendance automatically. It eliminates the need for manual attendance and ensures greater accuracy and convenience.

Features

Face Detection: Detects faces in real-time using OpenCV.

Face Recognition: Identifies registered faces and matches them against the database.

Attendance Logging: Automatically logs attendance for recognized individuals.

CSV Export: Saves attendance records in a CSV file for easy tracking and analysis.

User-Friendly Interface: Simple interface for registering new faces and marking attendance.

Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.6+

Required Libraries:

OpenCV

NumPy

dlib (for face encoding)

face_recognition

pandas

You can install the required libraries using:

pip install opencv-python numpy dlib face-recognition pandas

Installation

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/attendance-face-opencv.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd attendance-face-opencv

Install the required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

How It Works

Face Registration:

Capture and store face encodings for individuals who need to be recognized.

Real-Time Recognition:

Use a webcam to capture live video and detect faces.

Compare detected faces with the registered database.

Mark Attendance:

Log the attendance of recognized faces along with timestamps.

Export the data to a CSV file.

Usage

Register New Faces

Run the register_faces.py script:

python register_faces.py

Follow the prompts to capture face data for new users.

Mark Attendance

Run the mark_attendance.py script:

python mark_attendance.py

The system will start the webcam and mark attendance for recognized faces.

View Attendance

Check the attendance.csv file for logged attendance data.

Future Enhancements

Integrate with a database (e.g., MySQL) for better scalability.

Add a web-based or mobile-friendly interface.

Implement notifications for missed attendance.

Include support for multiple cameras.
