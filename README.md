# Attendance System Using Face Recognition

This project is an **Attendance Management System** built using Python and OpenCV that leverages **face recognition technology** to mark attendance automatically. It eliminates the need for manual attendance and ensures greater accuracy and convenience.

---

## Features

- **Face Detection**: Detects faces in real-time using OpenCV.
- **Face Recognition**: Identifies registered faces and matches them against the database.
- **Attendance Logging**: Automatically logs attendance for recognized individuals.
- **CSV Export**: Saves attendance records in a CSV file for easy tracking and analysis.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple interface for registering new faces and marking attendance.

---

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Python 3.6+**
2. **Required Libraries**:
   - OpenCV
   - NumPy
   - dlib (for face encoding)
   - face_recognition
   - pandas

You can install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy dlib face-recognition pandas
```

---

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/attendance-face-opencv.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd attendance-face-opencv
```

3. Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## How It Works

1. **Face Registration**:

   - Capture and store face encodings for individuals who need to be recognized.

2. **Real-Time Recognition**:

   - Use a webcam to capture live video and detect faces.
   - Compare detected faces with the registered database.

3. **Mark Attendance**:

   - Log the attendance of recognized faces along with timestamps.
   - Export the data to a CSV file.

---

## Usage

### Register New Faces

1. Run the `register_faces.py` script:

```bash
python register_faces.py
```

2. Follow the prompts to capture face data for new users.

### Mark Attendance

1. Run the `mark_attendance.py` script:

```bash
python mark_attendance.py
```

2. The system will start the webcam and mark attendance for recognized faces.

### View Attendance

- Check the `attendance.csv` file for logged attendance data.
